# EU Housing Market Visualization

## Overview
This project presents an **interactive exploratory visual analysis of housing prices in the European Union**, with a focus on the relationship between **real estate price dynamics**, **interest rates**, and broader macroeconomic indicators over time.

## Research Questions
The project addresses the following questions:
- How have housing prices evolved across EU countries over the past decade?
- What structural changes are visible after the rise in interest rates starting in 2022?
- Are housing price trends consistent across regions, or do significant disparities exist?
- Is there an observable correlation between interest rate changes and housing price growth?

## Data Sources
All datasets used are **publicly available and authoritative**:

- **House Price Index (HPI)** – Eurostat  
- **ECB Key Interest Rates** – European Central Bank  
- **Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP)** – Eurostat (optional extension)

The datasets were preprocessed and aligned to a **quarterly time resolution** to ensure consistency across sources.

## Visualizations
The application includes the following interactive visual components:

- **Time-series line charts** showing housing price trends by country  
- **Dual-axis line charts** comparing housing prices and interest rates  
- **EU choropleth map** displaying housing price growth across countries  
- **Scatter plots** exploring correlations between macroeconomic variables  

All views support interaction such as filtering, brushing, hovering, and coordinated updates.


## Technologies Used
- **D3.js** – data-driven document manipulation and visualization  
- **HTML5 / CSS3** – layout and styling  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – application logic and state management  

No external visualization frameworks were used.
